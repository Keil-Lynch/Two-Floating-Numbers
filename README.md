# Two-Floating-Numbers
In defining a floating-point, as the name implies, it is a special type of data that's built into the compiler that allows value definitions with floating decimal points. 

1. A program must find the product of two floating numbers num1 and num2, which could equally be termed A and B variables. 
2. The output of this program is the result of multiplying two floating point numbers. 
3. Users enter two float numbers into this program, which stores them into num1 and num2, and then runs. 4. Once entered the numbers will have been multiplied and the program will display the output produced as a result.
